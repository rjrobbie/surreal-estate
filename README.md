## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I will be able to answer "yes" to the following questions:
Am I able to explain what Single Page Application means and what client-side routing is?
Can I use React Router to define and navigate between routes?
Can I create forms in React?
Can I read and understand API documentation?
Can I make requests in Postman to an external API and can I translate these requests into my React application?
Can I implement 3rd party authentication?

## Concepts

I will learn and apply the following concepts:
Single Page Application (SPA)
Client-side Routing
Controlled Inputs
HTTP Requests
API Interaction
OAuth

## Challenge

I will create a property search engine that will have multiple pages:
A listings page where I can search for different properties and sort/filter the results.
An add property page where I will add new properties.
A property page.
Properties will come from an API that I've created.
